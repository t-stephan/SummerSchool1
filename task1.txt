The task given was to install a program using a package management tool. Since I am operating on a Windows machine, I first had to install such a tool. I went with the lecturers recommendation and chose Chocolatey. 

Once I had Chocolatey installed, the process of installing a program with it was most trivial. The program I chose to install next was 'vim'. To do so, I typed 'choco install vim' and confirmed that I want the script 'chocolateyInstall.ps1' to be run afterwards in order to install vim. Then Chocolatey did all the remaining work and installed the program. After that, vim was fully operational.

The attached screenshot documents the process of installing vim as described.
